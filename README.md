# taxonomy-of-human-social-perception
This repository contains anonymized perceptual  rating data of social features from movies and the analysis scripts used in the publication "Taxonomy of human social perception" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.28.559888v1). The publication describes how people perceive social features from natural scenes. The study investigates i) whether social perception is binary (feature is perceived either present or absent) or continuous (feature is perceived with varying intensity), ii) how consistently people perceive different social features and iii) what are the main perceptual dimensions people perceive from social scenes.

The results of the publication can be replicated by running the provided analysis scripts in the numbered order.

The scripts and anonymized data are freely available to use. Please, cite the publcation (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.28.559888v1) if you use these script or data.
